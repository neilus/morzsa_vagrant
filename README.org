* What is Vargant in a nutshell
- managing virtual development environments
- using different virtualization engines as "providers"
- extensible via plugins
- supports "pluggable" provisioning systems
- public registry of base "boxes" (like dockerhub)


** Vagrant arhitecture

** Softwares used
For this demostration I have used [[https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.7.4/][vagrant version 1.7.4]] instead of the latest 1.8.1, because at the moment the libvirt provider - which is a community plugin - is not compatible with the latest release.

Installed 3rd party plugins
#+begin_src sh
vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt # libvirt provider
vagrant plugin install vagrant-openstack # openstack provider
vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxmox # proxmox provider
vagrant plugin install landrush # dnsmaq plugin, to resolve VM names as vmname.vagrant.dev
#+end_src

* Developer's day

** vagrant up --provision
- base box
- provisioner
  - inline shell
  - shell script
  - puppet
  - chef
  - salt
  - *Ansible*
** Using sync folder
- (default) providers shared folder feature
- NFS (the host is the server, needs sudo priviledges)
- SAMBA (same as NFS)
- rsync (one-way, host -> guest)
  - rsync-auto
** sharing environment
**** Vagrantfile (include in the project repo)
**** boxes (via the hashicorp atlas registry or http)
**** vagrant share (via hashicorps atlas)

** tidy up & recreate env
#+begin_src sh
$ vagrant destroy
$ vagrant up
$ ## or force reprovision
$ vagrant up --provision
#+end_src
*** deploying to a remote env
    (libvirt, OpenStack, Proxmox, EC2, Rackspace

**** "local" providers
- needs a base box for the provider
- spins up a VM locally (in case of libvirt can be remote host)


**** cloud providers
AWS, OpenStack, Proxmox
- does not upload the base image
- provider base image id or name
- no need to specify a base box in newer versions

* Infrastruture guy's day

** Boxes, providers
- each provider has to have a base box
- you can build your own

*** vagrant package
- works only with VirtualBox
- still have a need of a base box

*** packer
- separate project by hashicorp
- builds an image from scratch
  - install ISO
  - kickstart file/asnwer file
  - JSON file
